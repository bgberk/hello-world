Dear [contact]:

My name is Benjamin Berk, and I am a 27-year old beer lover coming to Brisbane on holiday from the United States on February 15 with a Work & Holiday visa. This allows me short-term employment (6 months or less), and I aim to gain experience at one of Brisbane's excellent craft breweries. [personal sentence]

In the US, I teach English as a Second Language, but I pursue homebrewing as a hobby. I have brewed small-batch beers and ciders successfully and eagerly study the craft and science of brewing. Also, in the past year and a half, I have volunteered with six craft beer festivals in northern Virginia--a region with countless craft breweries like yours starting up--representing breweries like <a href = "http://www.madfoxbrewing.com">Mad Fox</a> and <a href = "http://www.adroit-theory.com">Adroit Theory</a>. 

As a result, I have a background in the process of brewing, kegging, describing, and serving beer. If there is any opportunity to use some or all of these abilities to help at [brewery], I would be glad to discuss it with you. If not, I will certainly visit to have a beer during my stay!

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Benjamin Berk
