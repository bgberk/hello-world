Brewery Job Request Letter

Dear [contact]:

My name is Benjamin Berk, and I am a 27-year old coming to Brisbane from the United States in the middle of February on a Work & Holiday visa. This allows me short-term employment (6 months or less), and I am very interested in working at an Australian craft brewery.

In the US, I worked as a teacher of English as a Second Language, but I pursued homebrewing as a hobby. I have brewed several batches of beer and cider successfully and read multiple resources on the art of brewing. Also, in the past year and a half, I have volunteered with six different craft beer festivals in northern Virginia--a region with countless breweries starting up. 

As a result, I have a background in the process of brewing, describing, and serving beer. If there is any opportunity to use some or all of these abilities to help at [brewery], I would be glad to hear the details. Either way, I will certainly visit to have a beer during my stay!

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Benjamin Berk
